Need: (what need does this app fulfill)
We need to prove to our ISP that the speeds and 
reliability that they are claiming to be providing 
do not match what we are receiving.

Purpose:
This app will test both the ping times and the speeds of a network
and collate that data into a databse.


Design:
The service:
The service must reliably continue to run once run
The service must reliably store the data to the database

The Database:
Design:
   
   Pings Table:
      ID
      ping_value
      DateTime
      ipv4_id
      service_id(only if singular database used)
The database may be run on a singular machine to accept data from multiple services
   IF the database is run on only one machine:
      The database must store the LAN IP of the device or another unuiqe identifier along with the data described in the DB Design
